# Best Bank - Group Project

![Best Bank logo](assets/bestbank_logo.gif)

NOTE: while this project is available in the "public space", it is designed for **Scrimba Bootcamp** students and is based on the **Best Bank** module 4 [solo-project](https://v2.scrimba.com/s03f3jq) created by _Rafid Hoda_.

The minimum requirements are the _basic JavaScript and CSS skills_ taught in **Scrimba Modules 3 & 4**.

For those who've completed the **Best Bank** solo-project, you'll notice the _Group Project_ has some additional requirements and you're encouraged to add new features.

Please keep in mind that the main goal of the group project is to gain some _basic experience_ developing a **JavaScript Web App** with another developer using a shared GitHub repository. This means you'll _both_ need to plan what features to develop, then decide on the order to add them, along with who will work on each feature.

## Step 1

Students are encouraged to post a message in the **Scrimba Bootcamp Discord** "collaborative-work" channel that they're looking for a project partner. And while three students may collaborate on this project, you'll probably find it quicker to just find one partner and immediately begin planning how to divide the tasks.

## Step 2

One person will Fork the [ScrimbaBootcamp Best Bank repository](https://github.com/ScrimbaBootcamp/best-bank-app/tree/main) into their personal GitHub account, as a separate public repo, and then add the other person(s) as project collaborator(s). The collaborater(s) will need "Write" access in order to upload and merge changes into their group's main branch.

Note: the **ScrimbaBootcamp repo** was set up with _Vite_. If you're unfamilar with using _Vite_, please visit [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/) to learn more.

## Step 3

Using **GitHub Desktop**, set up a local repo.

You can initialize your local repository by running the "npm install" command in a Terminal within your VScode app. You may be asked to install some required/suggested updates.

Thereafter you will run "npm run dev" from the Terminal command line in VScode to start the project's development environment. For me, the browser runs on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)

## Step 4

Meet online to discuss and plan how to divide the development tasks.
