# Best Bank - Group Project

![Best Bank logo](assets/bestbank_logo.gif)

NOTE: while this project is available in the "public space", it is designed for **Scrimba Bootcamp** students and is based on the **Best Bank** module 4 [solo-project](https://v2.scrimba.com/s03f3jq) created by _Rafid Hoda_.

The minimum requirements are the _basic JavaScript and CSS skills_ taught in **Scrimba Modules 3 & 4**.

For those who've completed the **Best Bank** solo-project, you'll notice the _Group Project_ has some additional requirements and you're encouraged to add new features.

Please keep in mind that the main goal of the group project is to gain some _basic experience_ developing a **JavaScript Web App** with another developer using a shared GitHub repository. This means you'll _both_ need to plan what features to develop, then decide on the order to add them, along with who will work on each feature.

## Step 1

Students are encouraged to post a message in the **Scrimba Bootcamp Discord** "collaborative-work" channel that they're looking for a project partner. And while three students may collaborate on this project, you'll probably find it quicker to just find one partner and immediately begin planning how to divide the tasks.

## Step 2

One person will Fork the [ScrimbaBootcamp Best Bank repository](https://github.com/ScrimbaBootcamp/best-bank-app/tree/main) into their personal GitHub account, as a separate public repo, and then add the other person(s) as project collaborator(s). The collaborater(s) will need "Write" access in order to upload and merge changes into their group's main branch.

Note: the **ScrimbaBootcamp repo** was set up with _Vite_. If you're unfamilar with using _Vite_, please visit [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/) to learn more.

## Step 3

Each person will then clone the group's GitHub repo to their computer to set up a local repository that can be opened with VScode and be used for storing local commits (changes). Then, from time-to-time, you will sync your "good" changes to the group's GitHub repo.

I like using the **GitHub Desktop app** (instead of the command line) to create the local repo and thereafter check for changes made by others to the GitHub repo. I can then use app's "sync" option to download changes made by others.

## Step 4

Initialize your local repository by running the "npm install" command in a Bash Terminal within your VScode app. You may be asked to install some required or suggested updates.

Thereafter you can run "npm run dev" from the same Bash Terminal (in VScode) to start your project's development environment. For me, the development browser runs on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/).

## Step 5

Meet online to discuss and plan how to divide the development tasks based on the [project description](https://v2.scrimba.com/s03f3jq). For example, plan for and decide who will...

1. create the HTML code with text content separated by Semantic elements.
2. create CSS general styling and content styling to match the UI design.
3. create Pay/Transfer buttons that activate overlay modals
4. create Accounts and Spendings components
5. and so on

## Step 6

Setup a [GitHub Page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to automatically publish your developing project to the web to help you review/test your code.

## Step 7

For your group project review, you can either submit it the usual way or [Request a Call](https://different-marmoset-f7b.notion.site/Scrimba-Bootcamp-33dfd67a626f4c3bbc1e865ac609e62b) with a Scrimba Bootcamp reviewer and request a 1-1 session instead of a scrim recording so group members can ask questions.

## Suggestions

- it's usually better to make several small "good" updates, eg. after each sub-task is completed,than wait until a complex task is completely finished before uploading to the shared GitHub repo.
- it's important to continually communicate with your partner(s) to let them know what you're working on and how your development is updating. A quick message in a shared Discord "Group DM" at the start and end of your planned 2-3hr coding time-block, to state what you'll be working on and what progress you made, would go a long way to keeping everyone up-to-date.
- ask for help if you get stuck on a project task or issue... often just chatting about it will help you reformulate the problem enough to find a working solution.
- ask your partner(s) to review your code... it's much easier to make small code fixes early in the project than have to do large rewrites later on.
- have fun and keep in mind the group project is primarily for learning how to work with others on a group project using a shared GitHub repository.
